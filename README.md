-= Bugger! =-

Bugger! takes classic Frogger and tweaks it a little. World War Ten has come and gone (the space-metal band
that's heavier than the elements being fused in the core of your nearest star) and all that's left behind are
you, the cockroaches, and the fake gems that fell out of the bassist's hair during the bangin' solo.

Instead of crossing to the other side of the road without ever answering that cosmic conundrum, "Why?"
the player must avoid the bugs and collect the gems (it's what passes for currency at the merch table).
The bugs overturned the hotdog cart and finished off the final 'furter. How much can you scrounge together
before you get swarmed?

Instructions:

Use the arrow keys to move the player around the ruined concert site. A gem will appear in a random location.
Collect the gem to increase your score. When the gem is collected, another gem will appear in another random
location. The bugs will swarm from both the left and the right sides. The ones just off the hotdog cart might
move relatively slow (the buns expand in the stomach). The hungrier bugs are feral and move much faster.
Be careful not to get ambushed by a fresh bug coming in from just outside your field of view!!!
